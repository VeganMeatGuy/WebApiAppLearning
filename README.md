#personal learning Angular + .NET integration project

## 🎯 Project Target Clarification

### 1. Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a modern **full-stack application** that connects an **Angular frontend** with a **.NET backend API**.  
The application will evolve step-by-step — starting as a local browser app and expanding into a web-hosted or desktop & mobile(-native) version.

This project focuses on:
- **Technological consistency** — a unified stack (Angular + .NET) across desktop, web, and mobile.
- **Clean architecture** — clear separation between UI, API, and infrastructure layers.
- **Incremental development** — progress through well-defined milestones and integration stages.
- **Security and integration** — authenticated communication between client and API endpoints.
- **Scalability** — preparing the system for containerized and cloud-hosted environments.

### 2. Project Objectives
- Build a Angular application for local execution.
- Create a **.NET API** that provides core business logic (e.g., counter functionality).
- Gradually containerize the API using **Docker** and host it locally, then in a web environment.
- Implement **authentication and authorization** for secured API access.
- Extend the Angular app for desktop and mobile usage).
- Document integration pathways, challenges and take aways for future (hopefully usefull) projects (local, Docker, web, and mobile).
